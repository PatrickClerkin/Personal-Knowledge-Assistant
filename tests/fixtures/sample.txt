Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects,
which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields, and the code is in the
form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that methods are attached to them and can
access and modify the object's data fields.

Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the
restricting of direct access to some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide
the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to
them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details.

Inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class,
retaining similar implementation. When a class is derived from another class, it inherits
the methods and fields of the parent class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a
natural hierarchy between classes.

Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. A
polymorphic type is one whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type.
This allows for flexibility and extensibility in software design.

Composition is the principle of building complex types from simpler ones by combining
objects rather than inheriting from a base class. It is often preferred over inheritance
because it provides greater flexibility and avoids the tight coupling that inheritance creates.
